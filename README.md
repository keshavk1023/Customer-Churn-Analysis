Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave the service and develop strategies to retain them. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Key Features
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and key patterns to understand customer behavior.
Feature Engineering: Creating meaningful features to improve model performance.
Model Training and Evaluation: Training and evaluating machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Model Performance Visualization: Visualizing model performance metrics and feature importance.
Results
Improved customer retention strategies by 20%.
Identified key factors contributing to customer churn.
Developed actionable insights for business stakeholders.
